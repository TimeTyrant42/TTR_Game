This file explains all the things that are in the coded game that are different 
from the rules described in the "TTR_Rules" file

1)
Removed the game mechanic of players having a certain number of trains which
dictated the end of the game.
The game will now end when there are no more tracks left. I think this change is 
reasonable because the game board is not so big that train count is needed to 
determine the end of the game. Also since it will be a lot of AI vs AI they 
dont care how long the game lasts; they "have nothing better to do".

2)
DTM will now only include information availiable to the player who the DTM will
be created for. This will reduce the feature set and allow for interpertation to 
be seperate for each player. 
My fear with this is that we will lose important data related to the game state
but the reason I went ahead with this change anyway is beacuse I think it will be
more important to be able to evaluate and distinguish the DTM for each player 
from the same game.

3)
A destination card can be drawn as a turn option. This has always been the plan but
was accidently left out of the "TTR_Rules". When you draw a destination card there 
is no longer an option to not keep it. When you draw a destination card you get a 
random destination card added to your hand of destination cards. It is now possible
to have both players draw the same destination card

4)
A limit of 14 cards in you hand at any point was added. Originally there was no
limit on hand size. This change was made since we needed to display the cards
in the human player's hand visually and there is a limit to how much space the 
player's hand could take up on the screen.
